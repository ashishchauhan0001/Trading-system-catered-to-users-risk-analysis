# Trading system catered to users risk analysis
 
The objective of this minor project is to devise a system that aids investors in determining exit points based on stop losses and market trends. Typically, traders rely on charts, indicators, and historical patterns to make investment decisions. However, these tools aren't foolproof, as unexpected market behavior can defy established trends or provide false information, leading to losses.

The system aims to mitigate such risks by incorporating stop losses, investor-set targets, and risk-to-reward ratios into its analysis. When an investor enters the market, they allocate funds based on chart trends and candlestick patterns. Yet, deviations from anticipated trends can occur, prompting the need for an exit strategy. This system steps in by not only tracking market trends but also considering individual investor preferences and risk management.

The primary focus lies in developing a framework that doesn't solely rely on traditional trend analysis but incorporates exit points based on stop losses. By doing so, it intends to enhance decision-making by offering a more comprehensive approach to managing uncertainties and unexpected market movements. Ultimately, this project seeks to provide a more nuanced and adaptable strategy for investors to optimize their trades and minimize potential losses in the dynamic stock market landscape.
